*Hello! Thanks for checking out this post for our newest hire in Washington, DC. If you like what you see, send us your resume and a short note so we can learn more about you. We look forward to hearing from you.*
*Ashley and the vizzuality team*

## Job opportunity:

At vizzuality, we use data, technology and design to tell stories that inspire new learning and action on behalf of our environment and our communities. We work with the world’s leading nonprofits, research institutes, governmental organizations and companies to bring their data to life through beautifully-designed, easy-to-use digital tools and technologies. Our international team of 35 designers, developers and project strategists are located across three offices – Madrid, Spain; Cambridge, England; and now in Washington, DC. 

As the second hire in vizzuality’s new DC office, you’ll work directly with our Vice President, Development and Impact and our extended global team to help build vizzuality’s physical presence in DC – growing our work in the US while always connecting back to our broader efforts around the world. This is a truly unique opportunity to put your stamp on a growing, mission-driven technology company and shape our business and our impact.

## As community manager, your focus areas will be:

## Community building through communications and marketing
* Partner with our VP to foster our community in DC – brainstorming new business development initiatives to grow our network, planning and executing local events, identifying conferences and speaking opportunities to promote our work, and other experiments for outreach
* Collaborate with our Lead Writer and other teammates to explore new ideas for social media and other marketing or communications pieces, and write articles about vizzuality’s work

## Business development research and proposal writing
* Author written proposals and presentations for new business, in collaboration with others across our team
* Research opportunities to pitch our work to new clients or partners 
* Help shape our point of view on what types of projects we should be taking on

## Rolling up your sleeves to support our work and our growth
* Act as ‘right-hand’ for our VP – managing office logistics and other administrative or project-related tasks as needed
* Support the creation of office rituals and traditions (birthdays, lunchtime know-hows, and other team building activities)

In this role you’ll need to feel comfortable balancing lots of priorities and deadlines, and managing your time and your efforts to get things done. You’ll also need to be open to learning and experimenting as you go, as well as regularly reflecting on and measuring whether your experiments worked. With most of your teammates located across different continents, you’ll quickly get the hang of collaborating across time zones and platforms to brainstorm new ideas, troubleshoot obstacles, support our clients, and produce high-quality, high-impact work. And in the process, you’ll be helping to grow our work and our presence in DC, as well as our own culture and traditions as we expand our local team.

## You will excel in this role if you:
* Have experience starting something from scratch (for instance a campus club or a volunteer group)
* Are oriented toward community building, customer service and teamwork
* Have strong written, verbal and visual communication skills
* Worked in and/or are eager to learn more about topics like human-centered design, data visualization, technology, and innovation 
* Are interested in working in an international setting and learning about different countries and cultures
* Are passionate about working on some of the greatest social and environmental challenges of our time.
